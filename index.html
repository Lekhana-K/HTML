<h2><b>MY REVIEW</b></h2>
<p><strong>Money hiest , the best TV show I've watched so far it deals with mind games and strategies which makes you awestruck.If you're an amient fan of robbiers and like watching heists then this is a must watch .You'll never feel bored while binging on it .It is a very well made show with writing at its peak, the character development is fantastically detailed and yet so subtle because you wont get to know their real names.</strong></p>
